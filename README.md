a JWT Authentication REST API allows to register a user, log in as a registered user, get the user profile and log out a user.

## Why this project ?

## Required npm packages

Below is the required packages. They are installed by using npm.

`express` — A minimalist Web framework makes easier to build a HTTP server.

`nodemon` — The local server will be re-run automatically every time we modify the code.

`mongoose` — Elegant MongoDB object modeling tool which allows us to define schemas and do several operations to the database.

`bcrypt` — This will hash user passwords before storing them into the database.

`jsonwebtoken` — JSON Web Token(JWT) allows us to create protected API routes. Some routes will only be accessible by the logged user.

`validator` — This package will validate the user form input. We need to ensure the email is in the right format.

`mosha` — A JavaScript test framework provides a testing environment in which we can use our favorite assertion libraries to test the code.

`chai` — An assertion library which allows to test HTTP calls such as GET request, POST request, etc.
